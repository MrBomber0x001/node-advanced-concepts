# Intro

On this repo, I've tried my best to have more consistency explaining some of the advanced node concepts
for each concept I've included the following:

- Introduction to the concept with illustrative approach
- Examples
- A full project to get your hands dirty and see the concept in real world
- Resources for whom want to dig any further

## Contents

- Events
- Streams
- Child process
